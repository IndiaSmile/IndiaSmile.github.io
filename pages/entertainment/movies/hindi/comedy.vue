They are based on opposite sex interactions, old age hilarity, and foolishness of the youth! Donâ€™t think twice, just pick a movie from the list and laugh your days of isolation off! ðŸ¤£`,

The highpoint of the film isnâ€™t the script which is a foregone tale. Rather, it is the chemistry between the bunch of foolish boys! Hilarious!`,

One of Bollywoodâ€™s best movies.`,

Akshaye Khanna does a very good job in this movie! They provide quite a few scenes with hard laughs, but the best one is Paresh Rawal of course. He delivers another brilliant role just like in Hera Pheri.`,
