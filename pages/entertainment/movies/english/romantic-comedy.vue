          text: `There is no other feeling that literally gives you butterflies. Love is sacred and complex. Many embrace it, many lose it, many find it and many donâ€™t believe in it! The important thing is that we need love and kindness. In such times, we need to be supportive and kind, especially to the doctors and nurses that are fighting for our safety.ðŸ’– These are a list of comedy movies, with romance at its core, that you can cozy up and watch with your loved ones!`,

          text: `Phil, a self-centred weatherman, goes to the town of Punxsutawney for an assignment. He is later shocked when he wakes up the next morning and realises that he is reliving the same day over and over again. Bill Murray shines in this good-natured comedy that delivers lots of laughs and some honest sentiment.`,

          heading: 'Notting Hill',
          text: `William, a British bookseller, meets and falls in love with Anna, a high-profile American actress.

          text: `Childhood sweethearts have a falling out and don't speak for 15 years, only reconnecting as adults when they run into each other. Although the old sparks are still there, the couple live in different worlds.
